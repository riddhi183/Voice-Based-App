## Reporting a bug
We use GitHub issues to track bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue.
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A short summary 
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)


## Submitting a fix
All code changes happen through pull requests. To submit a fix:

- Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
- If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
- If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
- Ensure the test suite passes.
- Make sure your code lints.
- Issue the pull request.


## Proposing new features

All proposals will be tracked using GitHub issues. Open a new issue to submit a proposal. 
Before submitting a proposal:

- Check if there's already a package which provides that feature.
- Determine which repository the feature should be suggested in.
- Perform a cursory search to see if the feature has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

Good practices for proposing new features:

- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested feature in as many details as possible.
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
- Describe the current behavior and explain the behavior you expected to see instead and why.
- Explain why this new feature would prove to be useful.
- Mention some other projects where this feature already exists if possible.
